# OtherThing

## Why

Every developer has a graveyard of unfinished projects — the "other things" they'll get to someday. Not because they lack skill, but because they lack resources: compute is expensive, cloud providers see your code, and there's no way to safely outsource work without losing control of your IP. The result? Innovation dies in backlog purgatory while developers burn out on day jobs.

## Who

**Developers** — Solo devs and small teams with more ideas than infrastructure. They need affordable, trustless compute without sacrificing ownership.

**Compute Providers** — Anyone with spare cycles: a gaming rig, a home server, even a phone. They want passive income from idle resources.

**Clients** — Businesses and individuals who need development work done but want guarantees: code delivered, money protected, quality assured.

## How

OtherThing is a peer-to-peer compute marketplace where developers finish projects using distributed resources from a trusted network.

- **Self-hosted repos** — Your code never leaves your control. Agents only see what you share.
- **Escrow contracts** — Clients fund tasks upfront. Devs get paid on delivery. No trust required.
- **Compute rewards** — Providers earn OTT tokens for CPU/GPU/storage contributed to workspaces.
- **Device agnostic** — Model transformers abstract hardware. Contribute from any device.
